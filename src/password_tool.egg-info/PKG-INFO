# Password Strength & Hygiene Toolkit

A pragmatic, security-minded password analysis CLI. Built to showcase clean Python architecture, not AI spit-out code. Emphasis is on clarity, modularity, and real-world signals attackers exploit.

## Why It Exists

Most checkers stop at length + character classes. This tool layers:

- Entropy math (approximate brute force complexity)
- Human pattern detection (sequences, keyboard walks, repeats, leetspeak)
- Common password dataset checks
- Personal context leakage (names, emails, dates) you can pass in
- File audits with duplicate + reuse detection
- Secure generator with policy knobs
- Both textual and JSON reports for easy integration

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (editable)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev]

# CLI help
pwtool --help
```

## Typical Usage

```bash
# Single password analysis
pwtool analyze "P@ssw0rd2025!" --context "alice 2000-07-15 alice@example.com"

# Scan a file (one password per line)
pwtool scan passwords.txt --redact --json out.json

# Generate strong password
pwtool generate --length 18
```

## Design Highlights

- Each concern isolated in its own module under `src/password_tool`.
- Functional core + thin Typer CLI layer.
- Uses `secrets` for randomness, not `random`.
- Report objects kept simple (dict / dataclass) for portability.
- No external network calls; safe for offline audits.

## Reporting

Scan produces two artifacts when requested:

- Text report: human-readable summary.
- JSON: machine-consumable records including flags, entropy, estimated crack time.

## Estimating Crack Time

We assume an aggressive GPU rig (10^10 guesses/sec baseline) and approximate search space size from dynamic charset detection. This is an order-of-magnitude educational figure, not a guarantee.

## Extend Ideas

- Integrate public breach APIs (optional, gated)
- Add Markov model or probabilistic password rules
- Provide interactive TUI with Rich live updates
- Export CSV summary

## Testing

```bash
pytest -q
```

## Philosophy

Readable > Clever. Deterministic > Magical. Honest about limitations. This code should feel handcrafted—because it is.
